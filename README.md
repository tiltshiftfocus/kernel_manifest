# Paranoid Android GKI

## Setting up your machine ##

You must be running a 64-bit Linux distribution and must have installed some packages to build
Paranoid Android. Google recommends using [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop) for
this and provides instructions for setting up the system (with Ubuntu-specific commands) on
[the Android Open Source Project website](https://source.android.com/source/initializing.html#setting-up-a-linux-build-environment).

Once you have set up your machine according to the instructions by Google, return here and carry
on with the rest of the instructions.

## Grabbing the source ##

[Repo](http://source.android.com/source/developing.html) is a tool provided by Google that
simplifies using [Git](http://git-scm.com/book) in the context of the Android source.

### Installing Repo ###

```bash
# Make a directory where Repo will be stored and add it to the path
$ mkdir ~/.bin
$ PATH=~/.bin:$PATH

# Download Repo itself
$ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/.bin/repo

# Make Repo executable
$ chmod a+x ~/.bin/repo
```

### Initializing Repo ###

```bash
# Create a directory for the source files
# You can name this directory however you want, just remember to replace
# WORKSPACE with your directory for the rest of this guide.
# This can be located anywhere (as long as the fs is case-sensitive)
$ mkdir WORKSPACE
$ cd WORKSPACE

# Install Repo in the created directory
$ repo init -u https://github.com/pa-gr/kernel_manifest -b android12-5.10-marble
```

### Downloading the source tree ###

This is what you will run each time you want to pull in upstream changes. Keep in mind that on your
first run, it is expected to take a while as it will download all the required Android source files
and their change histories.

```bash
# Let Repo take care of all the hard work
#
# The -j# option specifies the number of concurrent download threads to run.
# 8 threads is a good number for most internet connections.
# You may need to adjust this value if you have a particularly slow connection.
$ repo sync --no-tags --no-clone-bundle --current-branch -j8
```

## Building ##

```bash
# Go to the root of the source tree...
$ cd WORKSPACE
# ...and run the builder tool.
$ ./build.sh

# Optional arguments:
# -f : Full LTO (longer build time, generates slightly more optimized kernel image)
# -c : Clean build (remove leftover from previous builds)
```
